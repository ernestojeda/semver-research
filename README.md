## ðŸ“¦ðŸš€ Semantic Release

### Website

* GitHub: <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release>
* Official: <https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/>

### Details

* Fully manages every aspect of the release of a project. Determines semver version based on conventional commit history
* Very popular 12k GitHub stars, [41K usage](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNDMwNDMzNw%3D%3D)
* Well Maintained
* Node based, would require used of node based docker image
* Good Documentation, lots of examples

### Features

* Fully automated semver version management
* Enforce Semantic Versioning specification
* Automated Changelog creation (conventional commits)
* package publishing
* release config stored in `.releaserc` file
  - supported formats .yaml/.yml/.json/.js
* plugin based, see notes below about plugins

### Release Steps

<https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#release-steps>

The typical release is based off of these plugins:

* `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`
  - Can release based off commit messages, First we analyze the commit message to decide if a new breaking change, feature or fix was included. If not, no release is needed.
* `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`
  - Next up we generate the CHANGELOG. The CHANGELOG content is generated by the release-notes-generator plugin and written by the changelog plugin.
* `@semantic-release/changelog`  -- generates CHANGELOG file
* `@semantic-release/npm` (this bumps version in package.json)...we could write our own plugin that bumps the version in a semver branch ??
* `@semantic-release/github` -- commit change back to GitHub, special commit message required to skip release automation

* New project ~ 1 Year old
* 113 GitHub Stars (Not a lot of adoption)
* Documentation not great
* Not very many features
* Plugin based
* Docker Support
  - registry.gitlab.com/go-semantic-release/semantic-release:latest

## Standard Version

A utility for versioning using semver and CHANGELOG generation powered by Conventional Commits.

### Website

* <https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version>

### Details

* Written in Javascript
* Automates the bumping of semver, no GitHub release
* Automated CHANGELOG generation
* Very simple, matches git-semver functionality the closest
* Well established project and community
* 4.7K GitHub Stars
* Documentation OK, All in README of repo
* Not too many examples
* Not very many features

### Features

* Config stored in project root in `.versionrc`, `.versionrc.json` or `.versionrc.js`
* Supports Pre-release tags

### How It Works

* Follow the Conventional Commits Specification in your repository.
* When you're ready to release, run standard-version.
* standard-version will then do the following:
  - Retrieve the current version of your repository by looking at `packageFiles`, falling back to the last git tag.
  - bump the version in `bumpFiles` based on your commits.
  - Generates a changelog based on your commits (uses conventional-changelog under the hood).
  - Creates a new commit including your `bumpFiles` and updated CHANGELOG.
  - Creates a new tag with the new version number.
